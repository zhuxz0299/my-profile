I am currently a Master student in Computer Science and Technology at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), starting from 2025. I previously obtained my Bachelor's degree (Honor) from the same university in 2025, where I ranked 5/102 with a score of 93.53/100.

My research interests include **Distributed Computing** and **System Optimization**.

I have worked on projects such as **SpaceExit**, enabling efficient adaptive computing in space, and **MMBench**, a benchmarking tool for multi-modal DNNs.
